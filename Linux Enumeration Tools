Several tools can help you save time during the enumeration process. 
These tools should only be used to save time knowing they may miss some privilege escalation vectors. 
Below is a list of popular Linux enumeration tools with links to their respective Github repositories.

The target systemâ€™s environment will influence the tool you will be able to use. 
For example, you will not be able to run a tool written in Python if it is not installed on the target system. 
This is why it would be better to be familiar with a few rather than having a single go-to tool.
